# What keeps you in testing. 

I fell into testing, like many I wasn't aware it was a career that existed when I got a job working as a software 
tester, I discovered that I liked it. 

Years later, I'm at a sort of crossroads, testing is no longer really lighting my fire any more. I'm somewhat in crisis
with this, I have enjoyed many years of testing and I'm in a great job with a great company. I've not felt like this
in other companies though. I think that this disconsolate feeling stems from the fact I'm a lone tester in a company 
rapidly approaching 50 employees, over half of which are developers. It's really hard for me to keep my enthusiasm up, 
or my passion, when I'm meant to be the sole source of inspiration for testing. In fact recently I've been more and more
tempted to slip sideways and go into a more development based role. Which is somewhat ironic because I always felt
that testing was my vocation and that I'd never use it as a stepping stone to being a full time programmer. 

What's keeping me testing is the hope that we'll very soon be hiring another tester. Having another person to bounce 
ideas and concepts off has always been useful and helpful for me. The company and the role is great but as you'll see
if you've been reading my blog, I've been unsuccessfully trying to hire another tester for a very long time now.

If you fancy helping me keep my testing spirit alive, details follow!

### Recruitment: 
Looking for a job in Cambridge (UK)?
I’m currently hiring for a second to help me steer and lead testing efforts at Geospock. The product is geospatial and temporal databases on a massive scale with attendant analytics and visualisation platforms. The testing problems are non-trivial, but interesting and engaging. Much of the testing is done by the developers, with the test role being more helping developers decide what to test and implementing frameworks and infrastructure to help the developers test. The test areas range from database testing, API testing, web testing to infrastructure testing and testing the limits of systems at massive scale.

We’re expanding this year as customers increase and the likelihood is that any new tester on my team would be mainly involved in helping create testing strategies and automation for customer deployments. Office culture is generally relaxed and fun, and we’re improving our facilities as we grow (new kitchen, games room, coffee machine coming shortly). We also have a good pension, dental, health and work from home is not unusual. Variable height desks for all and Mac or Linux as standard (Mac is more useful for a tester as we _do_ need to test against Safari). Languages we use are Java, Kotlin, Python3, Javascript, Ruby,  Scala, Erlang. You do not need to know all of these. Familiarity with and a modicum of experience in any scripting language would be great, anything beyond is a bonus. 

It’s cloud based mainly, so think AWS, Azure, Google Cloud etc. again you don’t need to be an expert in any of these, I’d never used them when I arrived. Familiarity and comfort with a Unix shell of some flavour would be a definite advantage as SSHing into a cloud machine to pull syslogs or tweak a set up is quite common.

If this rambling set of words hasn’t
