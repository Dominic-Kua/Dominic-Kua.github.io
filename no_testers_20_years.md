# In 20 years, software testers won't exist as a job title.

Quite the contentious title, deliberately so.

The role of a software tester as we know it today is a relatively young discipline, much younger than that of the 
software developer. What that says about the software industry is left as an exercise for the reader. However the role's 
existence may turn out to be a transitory phase in the software industry's history, as we're superseded by developer 
quality evangelists and greater use of automated systems, including today's paper tiger of artificial intelligences. 

Allow me to elaborate. There was a time (and in some companies this is still true), where a software tester was/is a 
warm body who can follow a script and raise a defect when something went awry. Nothing outside the scripts, just doing
what was asked and not a whit more. But some testers started to chafe, get creative, talk to developers and start to 
explore the product in new and unscripted ways. Now this is the norm and we're seeing the rise of a new breed of tester
one who lives closer to the code and spends more time helping the devs test than actually doing testing themselves.
It appears to only be a matter of time before the role of the tester is to write code, participate in code review and 
help the developers on the team to design and test their code. A "T shaped" developer who specialises in quality, rather
than a dedicated tester. Every team has specialisations, the GUI expert, the person who knows networking back to front
and soon, the developer who knows testing better. 

I fear we're soon to be on the scrapheap of history and left as a short-lived blip on the history of programming as 
the ideas of testing and exploration become embedded in the next generation of developers. I also don't think it's a bad
thing at all. Quality being everyone's responsibility means this is the natural progression.
