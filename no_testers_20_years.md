# In 20 years, software testers won't exist as a job title.

Quite the contentious title, deliberately so.

The role of a software tester as we know it today is a relatively young discipline, much younger than that of the 
software developer. What that says about the software industry is left as an exercise for the reader. However the role's 
existence may turn out to be a transitory phase in the software industry's history, as we're superseded by developer 
quality evangelists and greater use of automated systems, including today's paper tiger of artificial intelligences. 

Allow me to elaborate. There was a time (and in some companies this is still true), where a software tester was/is a 
warm body who can follow a script and raise a defect when something went awry. Nothing outside the scripts, just doing
what was asked and not a whit more. But some testers started to chafe, get creative, talk to developers and start to 
explore the product in new and unscripted ways.
