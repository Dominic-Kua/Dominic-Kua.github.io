# Little known thing about Testing. 

Insofar as most people know of software testing they mostly think in terms of making sure that the program does what 
it's supposed to and not what it isn't. Which is broadly true, but the prevailing idea outside the industry is that it's
largely rote application of steps to achieve a desired or expected outcome. 

For me, and for many others, this simply is no longer true. If you can reduce a process to this kind of simplistic list
by all means do it, but do it in automation where you can! Humans are slow, fallible and easily confused and imaginative
. Computers are fast, reliable, able to hold many things in memory at once, but completely unimaginative. So when you 
have a simple, repetitive task, hand it off to a computer, you'll be much happier and it'll be much more reliable. 

Testing these days is much, much more than rote checking and assessing. Most of the job is actually based on creativity 
and the so called "Soft Skills", combined with a slice of analytical thinking and domain knowledge. Testing is about 
learning and probing and experimenting and recording and analysing. Plodding through a test scrip is so passé when you 
can have a computer do that and free the humans for designing tests, code reviewing, pairing with developers and 
generally _thinking_ about the product and spotting where the flaws could be before they become actual bugs. Talking to 
developers, product owners and sometimes clients to discern the actual requirements. Converting test results into a 
sensible and comprehensible format for developers and non-developers.

Long story short: What people think testing is, is what computers are good for, what people don't think of is the 
thought, psychology and technical nous combined that a good tester needs.

### Recruitment: 
Looking for a job in Cambridge (UK)?
I’m currently hiring for a second to help me steer and lead testing efforts at Geospock. The product is geospatial and temporal databases on a massive scale with attendant analytics and visualisation platforms. The testing problems are non-trivial, but interesting and engaging. Much of the testing is done by the developers, with the test role being more helping developers decide what to test and implementing frameworks and infrastructure to help the developers test. The test areas range from database testing, API testing, web testing to infrastructure testing and testing the limits of systems at massive scale.

We’re expanding this year as customers increase and the likelihood is that any new tester on my team would be mainly involved in helping create testing strategies and automation for customer deployments. Office culture is generally relaxed and fun, and we’re improving our facilities as we grow (new kitchen, games room, coffee machine coming shortly). We also have a good pension, dental, health and work from home is not unusual. Variable height desks for all and Mac or Linux as standard (Mac is more useful for a tester as we _do_ need to test against Safari). Languages we use are Java, Kotlin, Python3, Javascript, Ruby,  Scala, Erlang. You do not need to know all of these. Familiarity with and a modicum of experience in any scripting language would be great, anything beyond is a bonus. 

It’s cloud based mainly, so think AWS, Azure, Google Cloud etc. again you don’t need to be an expert in any of these, I’d never used them when I arrived. Familiarity and comfort with a Unix shell of some flavour would be a definite advantage as SSHing into a cloud machine to pull syslogs or tweak a set up is quite common.

If this rambling set of words hasn’t put you off you can read the official spec [here](https://geospock.com/jobs/software-test-engineer/)
