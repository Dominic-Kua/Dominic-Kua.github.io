# What I learnt moving my blog

With this new lease on blogging, I wanted to start somewhere that made blogging easier. I've only ever really blogged on 
Wordpress and it was less than pleasant an experience for me. I've been meaning to try using git and vim to write a blog 
but never had gotten round to it. Now this is not written in vim. I've discovered that the markdown preview in Pycharm 
is really good and so I'm using that for the instant feedback on how it's going to look on the page.

So, what did I learn?

* I learnt that writing in Markdown is a lot easier than writing in a word processor and added formatting in later.
* I learnt that CSS is something I really should learn.
* I learnt that using git is really how my mind works, branches for each post make a lot of sense.
* I learnt that Markdown has its drawbacks and you _really_ need CSS for filling the gaps. 
* I learnt that lack of time is definitely more of an issue to me than having something to write about. 
* I learnt that trying to clever and starting a blogging club is still a lot of work!

Also, it's a lot of fun to work this way. Freeing yourself of the mindset of writing all in one go and allowing your 
thoughts to finish and treating each post as an on going work feels much more natural when it's version controlled.
