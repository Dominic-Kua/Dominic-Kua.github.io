# What I learnt moving my blog

With this new lease on blogging, I wanted to start somewhere that made blogging easier. I've only ever really blogged on 
Wordpress and it was less than pleasant an experience for me. I've been meaning to try using git and vim to write a blog 
but never had gotten round to it. Now this is not written in vim. I've discovered that the markdown preview in Pycharm 
is really good and so I'm using that for the instant feedback on how it's going to look on the page.

So, what did I learn?

* I learnt that writing in Markdown is a lot easier than writing in a word processor and added formatting in later.
* I learnt that CSS is something I really should learn.
* I learnt that using git is really how my mind works, branches for each post make a lot of sense.
* I learnt that Markdown has its drawbacks and you _really_ need CSS for filling the gaps. 
* I learnt that lack of time is definitely more of an issue to me than having something to write about. 
* I learnt that trying to clever and starting a blogging club is still a lot of work!

Also, it's a lot of fun to work this way. Freeing yourself of the mindset of writing all in one go and allowing your 
thoughts to finish and treating each post as an on going work feels much more natural when it's version controlled.

### Recruitment: 
Looking for a job in Cambridge (UK)?
I’m currently hiring for a second to help me steer and lead testing efforts at Geospock. The product is geospatial and temporal databases on a massive scale with attendant analytics and visualisation platforms. The testing problems are non-trivial, but interesting and engaging. Much of the testing is done by the developers, with the test role being more helping developers decide what to test and implementing frameworks and infrastructure to help the developers test. The test areas range from database testing, API testing, web testing to infrastructure testing and testing the limits of systems at massive scale.

We’re expanding this year as customers increase and the likelihood is that any new tester on my team would be mainly involved in helping create testing strategies and automation for customer deployments. Office culture is generally relaxed and fun, and we’re improving our facilities as we grow (new kitchen, games room, coffee machine coming shortly). We also have a good pension, dental, health and work from home is not unusual. Variable height desks for all and Mac or Linux as standard (Mac is more useful for a tester as we _do_ need to test against Safari). Languages we use are Java, Kotlin, Python3, Javascript, Ruby,  Scala, Erlang. You do not need to know all of these. Familiarity with and a modicum of experience in any scripting language would be great, anything beyond is a bonus. 

It’s cloud based mainly, so think AWS, Azure, Google Cloud etc. again you don’t need to be an expert in any of these, I’d never used them when I arrived. Familiarity and comfort with a Unix shell of some flavour would be a definite advantage as SSHing into a cloud machine to pull syslogs or tweak a set up is quite common.
