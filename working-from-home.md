# Working from home

Recently I changed jobs, I took a role with a company working entirely remotely.

## Why did I do this?

### Reason one: family. 
My daughter is just starting school and working from home means I can get to her school in 5 minutes flat if I'm needed, no waiting for buses, trains etc. We also do flexible working
so I can tailor my hours to fit me and the school day. Thus I work from 07:00 to 15:00 and then I get to spend the afternoon with my daughter.

### Reason two: selfishness.
I loathe commuting, even the small commute I did at my last job. It was, on paper, 4 minutes on the train, but then there was the walking to and from the station at both ends,
waiting for the inevitably delayed train. It all added up and I was shocked to realise I was losing _ten hours a week_ to commuting. When you factor in the hour of lunch where I was sat
around reading, I'm up to fifteen hours a week where I can do things around the house, spend with my family. That's like 2 working days a week extra time for me! It also helped that my 
last day commuting, my train to work was cancelled. It did not make me regret my choices. 

### Reason three: A new challenge. 
My old job was never easy. I was continually learning, growing, fighting against some of the most intractable and leading edges testing problems I've ever heard of. I mean there was basically
never a situation where I could take a solution off the shelf and apply it, I always needed to invent the framework, develop a solution, create a new way to do things. It was an exciting problem
space. But it was only one problem space. So while it was always novel within the space, I felt it was time to move outside that space.
