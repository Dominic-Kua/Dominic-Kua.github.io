# A non-technical skill every tester should have, but most don't

Listening to what people say, and asking them for more information 

Simple as that, learn to listen, learn to consider what you hear and ask questions to make sure you understand
and to fill in any gaps you know you don't understand. 

It sounds easy but it's surprisingly hard to really listen to everything someone has to say, hold it in memory while
they finish and then repeat it back to them in your own words to verify that you've got the same conclusion they have. 

Very short blog, but also very late, so it probably balances!
