# Most and least favourite thing about testing


# Least

Start with least and move to something more cheery.

My least favourite part of this job is probably interacting with people. I know this is anathema to most testers, but
for me it's extremely draining to talk to people face to face for any period of time. I find meetings very, very hard as
well, some people love to talk for hours in meetings, while every minute in a meeting is a pain for me. Especially when 
I am hungry. But it's an important part of being a tester so I do these things, I just don't enjoy it much!

# Most

This is more cheery.

What I love about my job is making it easier for developers to test, helping them to design tests, look at designs 
before they're implemented, jumping in code reviews and reading a potential bug before it gets merged. I love writing 
tools most of all though. Nothing makes my day like a authoring a little tool to make something easier, faster or less 
prone to mistakes. That's like a condensed version of software development, you get the hit of having created something
useful in a day or so rather than the longer timescales of a larger piece of software. Plus when people start using it
in anger, it's just wonderful.

### Recruitment: 
Looking for a job in Cambridge (UK)?
I’m currently hiring for a second to help me steer and lead testing efforts at Geospock. The product is geospatial and 
temporal databases on a massive scale with attendant analytics and visualisation platforms. The testing problems are 
non-trivial, but interesting and engaging. Much of the testing is done by the developers, with the test role being more 
helping developers decide what to test and implementing frameworks and infrastructure to help the developers test. The 
test areas range from database testing, API testing, web testing to infrastructure testing and testing the limits of 
systems at massive scale.

We’re expanding this year as customers increase and the likelihood is that any new tester on my team would be mainly 
involved in helping create testing strategies and automation for customer deployments. Office culture is generally 
relaxed and fun, and we’re improving our facilities as we grow (new kitchen, games room, coffee machine coming shortly).
 We also have a good pension, dental, health and work from home is not unusual. Variable height desks for all and Mac 
 or Linux as standard (Mac is more useful for a tester as we _do_ need to test against Safari). Languages we use are 
 Java, Kotlin, Python3, Javascript, Ruby,  Scala, Erlang. You do not need to know all of these. Familiarity with and a
  modicum of experience in any scripting language would be great, anything beyond is a bonus. 

It’s cloud based mainly, so think AWS, Azure, Google Cloud etc. again you don’t need to be an expert in any of these, 
I’d never used them when I arrived. Familiarity and comfort with a Unix shell of some flavour would be a definite 
advantage as SSHing into a cloud machine to pull syslogs or tweak a set up is quite common.
