# Most and least favourite thing about testing


# Least

Start with least and move to something more cheery.

My least favourite part of this job is probably interacting with people. I know this is anathema to most testers, but
for me it's extremely draining to talk to people face to face for any period of time. I find meetings very, very hard as
well, some people love to talk for hours in meetings, while every minute in a meeting is a pain for me. Especially when 
I am hungry. But it's an important part of being a tester so I do these things, I just don't enjoy it much!

# Most

This is more cheery.

What I love about my job is making it easier for developers to test, helping them to design tests, look at designs 
before they're implemented, jumping in code reviews and reading a potential bug before it gets merged. I love writing 
tools most of all though. Nothing makes my day like a authoring a little tool to make something easier, faster or less 
prone to mistakes. That's like a condensed version of software development, you get the hit of having created something
useful in a day or so rather than the longer timescales of a larger piece of software. Plus when people start using it
in anger, it's just wonderful.
