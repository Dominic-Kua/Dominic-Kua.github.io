# The perils and profits of overthinking

Overthinking, we've all done it, second guessing ourselves, reading far too much into our interactions with others, 
wondering if that terse email means that the sender is busy or that they're trying to tell you something else 

But there's the flipside, you notice that a page load is slow when a certain condition is fulfilled, the database always
falls over after about 18 hours, something appears to be random but there's a niggling thing you can't shake and you 
look deeper, you see that if the customer came from a certain site, their ads served caused slowness in the page, or
that 18.2 hours is 2^16 seconds, so something is overflowing. 


But how do you _stop_ overthinking? How do you recognise when it's not useful and stop shaving that yak?

For me I find that a good idea is to go pomodoro, focus on your task for the allotted time and when you hit a point 
where you're diverging from what your goal should be, you make a note of it for later and then carry on with a more 
focussed path. Then after you finish your session, pick up your notes and work from there. A little distance from the 
problem can really help add perspective. 


Sadly my last foray into pomodoro led to me writing a little application to do the timing for me! But I only did that 
_after_ the session had finished, so at least there was that.

### Recruitment: 
Looking for a job in Cambridge (UK)?
I’m currently hiring for a second to help me steer and lead testing efforts at Geospock. The product is geospatial and temporal databases on a massive scale with attendant analytics and visualisation platforms. The testing problems are non-trivial, but interesting and engaging. Much of the testing is done by the developers, with the test role being more helping developers decide what to test and implementing frameworks and infrastructure to help the developers test. The test areas range from database testing, API testing, web testing to infrastructure testing and testing the limits of systems at massive scale.

We’re expanding this year as customers increase and the likelihood is that any new tester on my team would be mainly involved in helping create testing strategies and automation for customer deployments. Office culture is generally relaxed and fun, and we’re improving our facilities as we grow (new kitchen, games room, coffee machine coming shortly). We also have a good pension, dental, health and work from home is not unusual. Variable height desks for all and Mac or Linux as standard (Mac is more useful for a tester as we _do_ need to test against Safari). Languages we use are Java, Kotlin, Python3, Javascript, Ruby,  Scala, Erlang. You do not need to know all of these. Familiarity with and a modicum of experience in any scripting language would be great, anything beyond is a bonus. 

It’s cloud based mainly, so think AWS, Azure, Google Cloud etc. again you don’t need to be an expert in any of these, I’d never used them when I arrived. Familiarity and comfort with a Unix shell of some flavour would be a definite advantage as SSHing into a cloud machine to pull syslogs or tweak a set up is quite common.

If this rambling set of words hasn’t put you off you can read the official spec [here](https://geospock.com/jobs/software-test-engineer/)
