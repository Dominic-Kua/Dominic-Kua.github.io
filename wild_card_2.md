# Duck risotto, Dominic style
## Equipment
* A good sharp knife
* A heavy and at least 5cm deep frying pan, 30cm or more diameter
* A wooden or silicone spoon to stir.

## Ingredients:

* 2 duck breasts, skin on
* 1 medium onion
* 2 shallots
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp fredhy ground black pepper.
* 1.5 litres duck stock
* 1 glass of dry white wine (optional)
* 300g of arborio rice
* 40g parmesan cheese, finely grated
* 1 tsp freshly ground nutmeg
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme to garnish

## Recipe
* Take 2 duck breasts, skin on, and fry in a dry frying pan for 2 minutes on a side, make sure to get the skin golden, but not blackened. Don’t worry if it’s not cooked all the way through. Remove from the pan, and carefully slice to a thickness of about 0.7 cm.
* In the same frying pan take finely minced onions and shallots, fry in olive oil on a low heat until soft.
* Add a quick grind of black pepper and fry on a higher heat for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
* Throw in the duck breast and the risotto rice, fry again for 2 minutes stirring constantly on a lower heat.
* Now start to stir in the duck stock (if you roast whole ducks you can get a decent amount of stock out of the carcass and freeze it) also add the wine here if you're using it
keep stirring and adding stock until the rice is just cooked, try a little to find out when it's done. It should be soft, but still have enough bite that it doesn't turn to mush in your mouth.
* Grate through a small handful of parmesan and a generous pinch of freshly ground nutmeg.
* Garnish with fresh thyme to serve
